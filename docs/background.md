# Background

## The Umm al-Qura Calendar

The Umm al-Qura calendar is the official Hijri lunar calendar of Saudi Arabia, adopted by the government in 1346 AH (July 1, 1927 CE) for administrative purposes. Named after Mecca (Umm al-Qura), this calendar uses astronomical calculations determined by King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) rather than traditional lunar crescent sighting.

This standardization was necessary for modern administrative functions including government operations, legal documentation, healthcare systems, and educational institutions, which require predictable date scheduling while maintaining cultural and religious significance.

## Calendar System Challenges

Saudi Arabia's dual-calendar environment creates specific operational requirements:

**Administrative Operations**: Government healthcare systems, civil registration, and legal documentation require Hijri date processing, while international compliance and business systems operate on Gregorian calendars.

**Research and Analytics**: Longitudinal studies, epidemiological research, and data analysis often span both calendar systems, requiring accurate temporal alignment for meaningful results.

**System Integration**: Modern information systems must interface between Hijri-based legacy data and Gregorian-based international standards, necessitating reliable conversion capabilities.

## Development Motivation

Dr. Mohammed Alshehri, a preventive medicine and public health physician, developed HijriDate to address conversion accuracy requirements in health data analytics. Existing conversion tools produced inconsistent results and had limited date range coverage, creating reliability issues for health studies and health system implementations.

Accurate date conversion is critical for:

- Population health analysis
- Public health surveillance
- Health system data integration
- Research requiring temporal precision

## Primary Source Verification

HijriDate was developed using systematic verification against original calendar sources rather than existing implementations:

**1343-1355 AH**: Archived Umm al-Qura newspaper issues containing official month start announcements

**1356-1411 AH**: KFUPM Comparison Calendar developed by King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals

**1412-1450 AH**: Official Umm al-Qura Comparative Calendar books (Taqwīm Umm al-Qurá al-muqāran)

**1451-1500 AH**: KACST official website data

This approach ensures accuracy against authoritative sources across the complete supported date range.
